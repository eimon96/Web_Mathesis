        <div class="song">
            <div class="verse1">Despite what is out there burning
                Our faces remain intact
                We hear the screaming of the voiceless
                Yet we are numb to the pain of others
                We filter out the light
                It never penetrates our blinding screens
                We can take a stand</div>
            <div class="chorus">But in the end it all means nothing
                We rage out but we are wasting away
                
                <div class=chor>From the roots below
                To the boundless stars above
                We are nothing at all</div></div>
            <div class="verse2">What separates us from the others
                A difference in choices made
                We take an insignificant stance
                What would we do in a opinion vaccuum
                When left unaccountable
                So here we are far from the world
                Just wasting away</div>
            <div class="chorus">Doing nothing being nothing
                We are the favoured design
                And we're wasting away
                
                <div class="chor">From the caves and embers
                To the heart of the beyond
                We are nothing at all</div></div>
            <div class="bridge">Here we are doing nothing
                Being nothing
                We are wasting away</div>
            <div class="outro">From the roots below
                To the boundless stars above
                We are nothing at all
                Wasting away</div>
